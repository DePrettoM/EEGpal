EEGpal release history
MD=Michael DePretto
MM=Michael Mouthon

Version 1.3 : 26.09.2024
- Improvement of ICA module. When it has to convert files in .set at the startup, add a progression bar. These temporary .set files are automatically delete after ICA decomposition because they are useless.
- Correction of the title for the main windows as well as fileCut and ICA module. 
- Modification of the script open_eph.m on line 81 in order that the loading of .ep file record the number of TF, number of channel in the header. The sampling rate still need to be enter manually after import. 
- Creation of a new module 'FindPeaks' which has two functions. Firstly, it allows you to find the highest positive (max) or negative (min) peaks in the specified time interval. The module generates an Excel file with amplitude and position (relative to the beginning of the file and not from the origin specified in a possible header file). 
  The user has the possibility to record a check file informing if no peaks (=1) or several peaks (=2) have been detected in the time interval. In the case of multiple peaks, the main output file will by default only record the maximum of the minimum. 
  The second functionality of this module is to calculate the average of the signal in the specified time interval. This would be useful for extracting values to make plots.  

Version 1.2 : 10.06.2024
- correction from MichaelDP of the reading of .locs coordinate file with the EEGpalCS_mod_Electrodes module. 
- in module Filtering +, adding the possibility to use the official eeglab script (pop_eegfiltnew) to compute the filtering
The user can still use the Signal Processing Toolbox script from Mathworks (filtfilt) to perform the filtering (default parameter). 
- in the module Interpolation, adding the possibility to use the official eeglab script (pop_interp) to perform a spherical interpolation (use of .locs file). 
The user can still use the Mike X Cohen script (interpolate_perrinX.m) which give similar result as the 3D Spline interpolation of Cartool (https://github.com/mikexcohen/AnalyzingNeuralTimeSeries/blob/main/interpolate_perrinX.m). This option is the default one.
- in the module ICA, add the possibility to the user to ignore Bad channel from the ICA decomposition. These channels will saved untouch in the file result (not delated)
- creation of module to detect electrod bridge (eBridge) on the raw data. It will generate a .xlsx file which can be load in the interpolation module. 
This option has been add because you might need to know if there is bridged channels before to run ICA. 
- correction of open_sef and open_eph in order that the events are a numerical matrix and not a cell array. 

Version 1.1 : 06.05.2024
- Fusion of version of MD and MM
- add of the ICA module
- add of the FileCut module
- correction of coordinate orientation in .set open/save
- correction of open_eeglab script with the MM version (event load in a 3 columns matrix instead of table)
- add the Bridge detection function in the interpolation module
- creation of global variable app.AppPath to save the location of the toolbox
- creation of global variable app.Version to save the version number of EEGpal, eeglab, clean_rawdata, cleanline, ICLabel. Value need a manual update in the startupFcn of the main EEGpal module. This info is used by modules to write the PIF
- change of the structure of 'eeglab_plugins' folder. Installation of the full version of EEGLAB 2023.1 with clean_raw_data, cleanline, ICLabel install in it (updates). Suppression of all other sub-folders which was containing duplicate of function available in EEGLAB installation folder. 
- small bug corrections

Version tested and validate by MM the 06.05.2024.
Small bugs remining: open_eeglab can not manager event name in text (but only numbers).
