EEGpal release history
MD=Michael DePretto
MM=Michael Mouthon

Version 1.2 : 10.06.2024
- correction from MichaelDP of the reading of .locs coordinate file with the EEGpalCS_mod_Electrodes module. 
- in module Filtering +, adding the possibility to use the official eeglab script (pop_eegfiltnew) to compute the filtering
The user can still use the Signal Processing Toolbox script from Mathworks (filtfilt) to perform the filtering (default parameter). 
- in the module Interpolation, adding the possibility to use the official eeglab script (pop_interp) to perform a spherical interpolation (use of .locs file). 
The user can still use the Mike X Cohen script (interpolate_perrinX.m) which give similar result as the 3D Spline interpolation of Cartool (https://github.com/mikexcohen/AnalyzingNeuralTimeSeries/blob/main/interpolate_perrinX.m). This option is the default one.
- in the module ICA, add the possibility to the user to ignore Bad channel from the ICA decomposition. These channels will saved untouch in the file result (not delated)
- creation of module to detect electrod bridge (eBridge) on the raw data. It will generate a .xlsx file which can be load in the interpolation module. 
This option has been add because you might need to know if there is bridged channels before to run ICA. 
- correction of open_sef and open_eph in order that the events are a numerical matrix and not a cell array. 

Version 1.1 : 06.05.2024
- Fusion of version of MD and MM
- add of the ICA module
- add of the FileCut module
- correction of coordinate orientation in .set open/save
- correction of open_eeglab script with the MM version (event load in a 3 columns matrix instead of table)
- add the Bridge detection function in the interpolation module
- creation of global variable app.AppPath to save the location of the toolbox
- creation of global variable app.Version to save the version number of EEGpal, eeglab, clean_rawdata, cleanline, ICLabel. Value need a manual update in the startupFcn of the main EEGpal module. This info is used by modules to write the PIF
- change of the structure of 'eeglab_plugins' folder. Installation of the full version of EEGLAB 2023.1 with clean_raw_data, cleanline, ICLabel install in it (updates). Suppression of all other sub-folders which was containing duplicate of function available in EEGLAB installation folder. 
- small bug corrections

Version tested and validate by MM the 06.05.2024.
Small bugs remining: open_eeglab can not manager event name in text (but only numbers).
